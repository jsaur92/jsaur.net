<p>
It's been a long time since I've started making music and I still haven't released anything I've been working on. I have a lot of things I want to do but I'm still working on my skills, so it may be a bit more time before I release my first song. <br><br>
I've currently got two different music projects going on, under two different artist names. "DJsaur" is going to be for mostly covers and remixes of songs, half silly and half serious. "550Fish" is going to be for original works and an overall more serious tone. <br><br>
I'm really excited to share what I've been working on, so stay tuned for more information!
