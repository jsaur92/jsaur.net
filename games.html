Some of you may have heard rumors of a secret project that has to do with a fan game of a popular video game franchise...<br><br>
That project has been canceled. I realized I was biting off more than I could chew and I wouldn't be able to make it all by myself with no budget. I want the project to one day exist but I gotta be super mega rich if I can make a giant game that I can't profit off of :( <br><br>
But, I am replacing it with a project that is very special to me! More information on that will be coming out soon-ish and by my estimation, the game will be available by next summer at the latest!!!
</p>

<p>
Until then, I still have a promise I have to fulfill, which was an in-browser game to play on this very website and some small downloadable games that I made in my game design class. Those are all made and ready to be shipped, I just gotta learn how to upload them to the website and then do that... ^^' <br><br>
If you want to see these projects, then bug me about it until I upload them :P
