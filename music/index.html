  <h1> <a href="../index.html">jsaur.net</a>/music</h1>

<p>
I recently published three original remixes on my YouTube channel, <a href = https://www.youtube.com/@djsaur-deco>djsaur</a>! I plan on uploading more remixes, covers, and original music as I make them.<br><br>
Today's featured song is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY_5Unxw1hU">Wake Up In the Morning Feeling Like a Blizzard</a>, a mashup of Like a G6 by Far East Movement and Tik Tok by Kesha. Normally I would add the featured song as an embeded video, but sadly YouTube does not allow videos that use compywrited songs to be embeded outside of their website so you'll just have to use the link ðŸ˜­.
