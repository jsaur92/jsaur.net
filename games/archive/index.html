<p>
The games listed here are all games I made during my Game Design & Development class during my senior year of high school. In that class, we had to make six games in one week each, and then one larger game prototype in the span of a month. The first four games and final game prototype had to be programmed in Java with the Processing application, which served as an additional challenge. You can download all of those games here, for Windows or Linux!<br><br>
Please note that you need Java installed on your device to play some of these games. Also, I have not checked the Linux builds of these games. Please reach out to me if something is wrong!

  <p2>This was the first game jam in this class. The instructions were to make a game of "Footsteps", a simple game we played on paper and then had to develop in Java. I decided to make it themed around a semi-popular gambling anime, "Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor".<br><br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Fish Game</button>
<div class="content">
  <p2>Our second game had much more relaxed requirements: we had to make a fishing game. I learned a lot about scope creep during this project, as I used a lot of dev time researching data on different types of fish to use for my game, and I ended up only using some of the data. If I were to make this again, I would spend less time getting data on fish, <br><br>
