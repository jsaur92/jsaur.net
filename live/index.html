<p>
I'm currently on a hiatus from streaming, and I'm figuring out how I want to continue. While in the past semester I solely streamed esports practice and tournaments, I am considering streaming game development instead. I'll probably make a decision my the end of February to see if I want to continue or not, and if so how so. <br><br>
Until then, you can follow me at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jsaur">twitch.tv/jsaur</a> so you'll be the first to know when I'm back.
