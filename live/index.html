I'm currently on a hiatus from streaming, and I'm figuring out how I want to continue. While in the past semester I solely streamed esports practice and tournaments, I am considering streaming game development instead. I'll probably make a decision my the end of January to see if I want to continue or not, and if so how so. <br>
