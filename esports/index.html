    I'm part of the Hoothoot Recruits, a Division 6 competitive Splatoon team! We're currently competing in LUTI Season 16, where we play a single best-of-9 against another team in our division every week over a couple months. You can check us out at our <a href = "https://sendou.ink/t/hoothoot-recruits">Sendou page</a> or come chat with us in our team <a href = "https://discord.gg/DtJX5V7E47">Discord server</a>! I also livestream many of our practices and tournaments, which you can see over at <a href = "https/jsaur.net/live">jsaur.net/live</a>!
